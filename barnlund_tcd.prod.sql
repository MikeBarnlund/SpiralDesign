In a previous article, I <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-foundation-harming-rather-than-helping-wordcamps">incorrectly labeled the foundation</a> as harming WordCamps. My main gripe was with the fact that some WordCamp organizers were being denied the ability to have high sponsorship caps and thus, it sometimes adversely affected the event either in terms of it&#8217;s size or type of venue they could hold the event in. As time has gone by, I&#8217;ve learned that the biggest mistake I made was contributing the organizing and running of WordCamps to the WordPress Foundation which is incorrect. WordCamp Central is the group responsible for all things WordCamp related while the WordPress Foundation oversees the use of the WordPress and WordCamp trademarks. Unfortunately in the original discussion, WordCamp Central and the WordPress Foundation were used interchangeably which muddied the conversation. </p>\n<p>Perhaps I should have known better, but even though I&#8217;ve been apart of the WordPress community for two years, the project has grown far beyond just being publishing software. There is the foundation, WordCamp Central, Automattic, WordPress.com, various Automattic owned services, Audrey.co, etc. It&#8217;s hard to place blame or hold anyone accountable when you have no idea who that person is or what project or group they belong to. It&#8217;s frustrating for me but I wonder if many people simply don&#8217;t care, just as long as WordPress remains awesome, easy to use publishing software? I&#8217;ve often felt that there should be some sort of WordPress White Pages so that the public can know who is responsible for what within the WordPress project. But since so many individuals mingle with various parts, that project would soon be a waste of time. </p>\n<p>P.S. <a href="http://perezbox.com/2012/05/wordcamp-san-francisco-2012-sponsorship-packages-kettle-meet-pot/#comment-242">There is hope for things to change for the better</a>. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-foundation-to-foot-the-bill-for-meetup-com-organizer-dues" rel="bookmark" title="WordPress Foundation To Foot The Bill For Meetup.com Organizer Dues">WordPress Foundation To Foot The Bill For Meetup.com Organizer Dues</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/virtual-wordcamp-virtually-disappears" rel="bookmark" title="Virtual WordCamp Virtually Disappears">Virtual WordCamp Virtually Disappears</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/all-we-want-to-know-is-why" rel="bookmark" title="All We Want To Know Is Why?">All We Want To Know Is Why?</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/2Cx2O1cuzp8" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 12 May 2012 12:40:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Donncha: Super Cache for the Weekend";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89497475";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://ocaoimh.ie/2012/05/11/super-cache-for-the-weekend/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3089:"<p>WP Super Cache 1.0 came out several months ago and while it worked fine for most people there&#8217;s always room for improvement and bug fixes.

This release adds some great new features, read on to find out more.</p>\n<h3><a href="http://android.wordpress.org"><img src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/version-2-1-wordpress-for-android-logo.jpg?w=270&h=300" alt="WordPress for Android Logo" title="WordPress for Android Logo" width="270" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-684" /></a>What&#8217;s New</h3>\n<h5>Comment Editing:</h5>\n<p>You can now easily edit comments in the app. Just tap the new &#8216;Edit&#8217; button when viewing a comment and you will be taken to a new screen where you can edit the comment information including the name, email, url, comment text, and status. Big thanks to contributor <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aerych/">aerych</a> for adding this feature!</p>\n<h5>Post Autosave:</h5>\n<p>To better protect the content you are creating, the app will now autosave posts you are editing every 60 seconds. We&#8217;ve also added a safeguard that will make sure that you want to overwrite local changes you&#8217;ve made to a post before refreshing the posts list.</p>\n<h5>New Scaled Image Setting:</h5>\n<p>Instead of only linking to the full size image, you can now set the width of the linked image to whatever you&#8217;d like. To activate the new setting, tap &#8216;Settings&#8217; and then tap the &#8216;Upload and link to scaled image&#8217; checkbox. Another big thanks to contributor <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dolittledk/">dolittledk</a> for adding this feature!</p>\n<h5>Additional Changes:</h5>\n<p>In addition to these great features, there&#8217;s also some other great new additions in the app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small updates to the UI</li>\n<li>New app icon</li>\n<li>Reliability improvements</li>\n<li>Performance tweaks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WordPress.com</h3>\n<h5>New Reader:</h5>\n<p>There&#8217;s an all-new reader in the app that makes it easier than ever to follow your favorite blogs on WordPress.com. We’ve added a bunch of great new features including simplified navigation between posts, the ability to comment on articles you like, and the ability to easily share posts to other apps on your Android device.</p>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>A round of applause for the fine folks who have worked on this release: <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dolittledk/">dolittledk</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aerych/">aerych</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/isaackeyet/">isaackeyet</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/mrroundhill/">mrroundhill</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/development/">are you next?</a></p>\n<h3>Get it!</h3>\n<p>We hope that version 2.1 will make it easier than ever for you to blog while on the go.

San Francisco 2012 has <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org/2012/05/03/2012-wcsf-sponsorship-packages-now-available/">released their sponsorship package prices</a> and once again, the prices almost demand that you include your first born with the top spot. In 2009, the <a href="http://2009.sf.wordcamp.org/2009/04/09/become-a-sponsor/">top sponsorship spot</a> for the event was $15,000. In 2010 the top sponsorship spot would have cost you the same amount, $15,000. Last year, the top spot would have <a href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/2011/06/08/calling-all-sponsors/">set you back $40,000</a>. While the sponsorship prices are astronomical compared to any other WordCamp in the U.S., the real issue lies within the fact that there appears to be a double standard when it comes to setting caps for sponsorship money. </p>\n<p>An <a href="http://perezbox.com/2012/05/wordcamp-san-francisco-2012-sponsorship-packages-kettle-meet-pot/">article on Perezbox</a> that talks about the issue has so far, generated a number of comments from WordCamp organizers. It was disheartening to read so many organizers with roughly the same complaint. Here are a few excerpts from their comments to give you a better idea of the crux of the matter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Couldn’t agree more. I remember being told by the WP Foundation that the highest level sponsorship package for WordCamp Philly was too high. The price was $2,500, so we were forced to bring it down to $2,000. So our HIGHEST level was identical to their LOWEST level.- Brad Williams organizer of WordCamp Philadelphia</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I organized Chicago in ’09 and ’10. The 2010 camp hosted 580 attendees and in Chicago, that is no small task. Each city has its own things to deal with … in Chicago its unions. 2010 cost us roughly $42,000.00 (and, in my opinion, it was a bare bones camp) – &#8211; and we raised that much through sponsorships, so we broke even. That was a couple of months before the Foundation took over. I was told that $30K for a local WordCamp was a ridiculous amount and way too much for a local camp…which is why the Foundation would be taking over to help local camps deal with these financial issues. &#8211; Lisa Sabin-Wilson organizer of WordCamp Chicago</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>As last years organizer of WordCamp Las Vegas I can totally understand and feel the frustration with the sponsorship package limits being set in place by the foundation, especially once you see that the price points for WCSF are so far above and beyond what is allowed. Overall I think the limits that are put in place for all of us common folk to follow is pretty low and should be revisited as the cost of WordCamp’s can vary on geographical location. &#8211; Shelby DeNike organizer of WordCamp Las Vegas\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I am one of the organizers of the Seattle WordCamp. We have almost 900 people in our local Meetup community and I know we easily could have packed in a 600 person crowd between us and the rest of the community with no problem, and we wanted to! We ran into a brick wall with the Foundation limitations that wound up restricting us to a 300 person venue due to lack of flexibility primarily in sponsorship abilities. &#8211; Ben Lobaugh organizer for WordCamp Seattle</p></blockquote>\n<p>If the WordPress Foundation is going to tell WordCamp organizers what the limit is on their sponsorship packages and quite possibly make it too low which can make or break an event, WordCamp San Francisco should be held to the same procedures. If WordCamp San Francisco can not put on a successful event because of the regulations of the WordPress Foundation, they should change its name so they can hold an event without anyone telling them what to do. But, <a href="http://perezbox.com/2012/05/wordcamp-san-francisco-2012-sponsorship-packages-kettle-meet-pot/#comment-190">I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be doing that</a> anytime soon. </p>\n<p>This site reaches thousands of people. <strong>I&#8217;m especially interested in hearing from WordCamp organizers.

The conference is being held in Chandler, Arizona which by the way, is a great name for a city between November 8th and 10th, 2012. There is room for around 150-200 attendees with ticket prices starting at $150.00. The tickets go on sale starting in June but most of the attendees will be personally invited. While Joshua and Sally Strebel are among those organizing the conference, this is not a Page.ly focused event. Among the list of confirmed speakers thus far include Mark Jaquith and Mikkel Svane, the CEO of ZenDesk. </p>\n<p>When I asked Josh why he&#8217;s helping to put on this event, here was his response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had this idea for a while and finally decided to execute on it after discussing it with others. People seem to agree that having a meet up of sorts to discuss best practices and learn from each others experiences and stories would be helpful. The programming is for the benefit of the businesses that drive the WordPress economy, not so much the end user of WordPress.  + it is a good excuse to get together with our peers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a great idea to me. There is already a lot of collaboration between commercial WordPress entities in the community but I think this will do a lot of businesses some good to get together in person, especially to share success and failure stories. One thing worth noting is that this is definitely not a WordCamp event as illustrated via their disclaimer. </p>\n<blockquote><p>This is not a WordCamp, and it has not been endorsed by or is affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. WordPress is a trademark of the WordPress Foundation, respect.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While organizing an event like this is not easy, it has to be considerably easier to be able to put on a conference about a specific aspect of WordPress with 0 restrictions. </p>\n<h2>Related But Not Required Reading:</h2>\n<p> &#8211; <a href="http://perezbox.com/2012/05/the-concept-of-a-pressnomics-conference/">The Concept Of A PressNomics Conference</a></p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/2ta2WdLTCH4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 04 May 2012 13:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WP Blackberry: WordPress for PlayBook Update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/?p=555";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/2012/05/03/v2-1-wordpress-for-playbook/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4315:"<p>An update to WordPress for PlayBook is now available on the <a title="App World link" href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/78913/" target="_blank">BlackBerry App World</a>.

Issues from outside of the classroom are being brought into school as a result of Facebook interactions and schools are powerless to do anything about it. I found out on my first day in my new job as ICT manager in a primary school in Middlesbrough, UK when I was asked “What can we do about Facebook?”</p>\n<p>Our school had experienced everything from name calling to death threats, doctored pictures to stolen identities; all of this from users who were still at least 4 years short of Facebook’s (all too easy to avoid) minimum age requirement of 13 years old. We needed to steer our students away from Facebook and toward something the school could police, and make sure we catch the others before opening Facebook accounts.</p>\n<p>That’s where BuddyPress came in.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress enabled us to start our own school-oriented social network, where children can communicate with their classmates in a safe and monitored environment. Every child was given a username and password as well as training on how to use the platform. We encourage responsible use of the Internet through teaching our children how to be good e-citizens. Our social network is treated like the children’s school books where the children should produce their best work at all times. This is imposed to produce an environment of high quality writing (typing) which in turn breeds good writing habits both online and in the rest of their school work.</p>\n<p>Our social network is hosted on the Internet rather than any internal school server and so it is easily accessible to the children at home which has further encouraged participation. The children have really enjoyed engaging with their classmates, and even their teachers, on the school social network; sharing brief conversations about both in school and out of school matters. Teachers are able to set tasks for whole class groups or give encouragement to individual learners. It’s a valuable tool to enhance communication between teaching staff, reminding colleagues of events, sharing resources for lessons, and taking care of administrative and social notices.</p>\n<p>The basic functionality of BuddyPress can be further extended through the use of the ever expanding Plugins library. We use <a href="http://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-docs/">BuddyPress Docs</a> where children can collaborate on a shared piece of work and teachers can make comments and suggestions to help the children to enhance it. We also have the <a href="http://buddypress.org/community/groups/cubepoints-buddypress-integration/">CubePoints for BuddyPress</a> plugin to encourage participation on our social network. Children are awarded points for logging in daily and posting comments and a chart showing to top users is displayed in the sidebar. Points can also be deducted for any issues both online and offline.</p>\n<p>In addition to the masses of free plugins that are available, we have a paid subscription to WPMUDEV’s <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/buddypress-group-calendar">BuddyPress Calendar Plugin</a> to help us to plan events in the school calendar such as Sports Day and Summer Fairs, or for individual groups such as fixtures for the school football team.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress is the perfect fit for our school. The flexibility and extensibility of the WordPress platform, the continually updated plug-in environment, well documented support, and the fact it’s all free, leads me to the conclusion that it can be just as successful in all other schools as it has been with ours. Thank you for the opportunity to share our story!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 May 2012 21:05:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Paul Gibbs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: Import/Export Options Now Available With Widget Logic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6552";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/Y31G0w7B2PE/importexport-options-now-available-with-widget-logic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2230:"<p>The latest release of one of my favorite plugins, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-logic/">Widget Logic</a>, now has the option to import and export options.

During the entire ordeal, WooThemes kept customers and the public updated with what they knew and what they were doing to fix the problem via <a href="http://demo.woothemes.com/dos/">their status blog</a>. Their status blog was updated multiple times a day. Many people commended the company on Twitter for doing such a great job and it&#8217;s definitely deserved. </p>\n<p>I wish companies whether they be WordPress based or not would so something similar when a crisis hits. Customers want to know what happened, what&#8217;s currently happening, who&#8217;s doing what, etc. When a crisis hits and takes a website offline, people don&#8217;t want a canned response to a support ticket or email, they want information. Information keeps customers calm or at least, calmer then they would be without it. I personally hate that feeling I get when a company seems to shove me off and pretends as if nothing is wrong. As for information, inform the masses, not just a few. That way, everyone is on the same page. Use your company site as a means of controlling the conversation so people don&#8217;t have to guess what&#8217;s happening. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/woothemes-to-go-back-to-their-roots" rel="bookmark" title="WooThemes To Go Back To Their Roots">WooThemes To Go Back To Their Roots</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/interview-with-adii-of-woothemes" rel="bookmark" title="Interview With Adii Of WooThemes">Interview With Adii Of WooThemes</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/woothemes-releases-survey-results-as-an-infographic" rel="bookmark" title="WooThemes Releases Survey Results As An Infographic">WooThemes Releases Survey Results As An Infographic</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q7eCddgrHkA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 May 2012 15:00:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 5/1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11359";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/XkeYrE6J20E/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1188:"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-google-connect/"><strong>Simple Google Connect</strong></a> is a framework and series of sub-systems that let you add any sort of Google based functionality you like to a WordPress blog.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-coming-soon/"><strong>WP Coming Soon</strong></a> adds a coming soon page with a countdown clock.</p>\n<h3>Updated plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/wordpress/email-log"><strong>Email Log</strong></a> allows you to log all emails that are sent through WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/keyring/"><strong>Keyring</strong></a> provides a very hookable, completely customizable framework for connecting your WordPress site to an external service.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loginradius-for-wordpress/"><strong>Social Login for WordPress</strong></a> lets your users log in and comment via their accounts with popular ID providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, Live, and over 15 more.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/XkeYrE6J20E" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 May 2012 14:00:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Alex King: RAMP v1.0.4 Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=13366";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://alexking.org/blog/2012/04/30/ramp-v1-0-4-released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:953:"<p>We pushed out an update to <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/">RAMP</a> today, our WordPress plugin that makes it easy for you to stage content for review in one environment, then push it to your production server once it&#8217;s ready to go.</p>\n<p>As the version number indicates, this release is primarily to deliver a few bug fixes.

The issue dealt with the shortcode generator.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The latest version (and most likely many previous versions) of the WooThemes WooFramework has a bug that allows any website visitor to run and see the output of any shortcode. This gives unauthenticated visitors the same power to execute code on the server as regular publishers have. WordPress installations with unsecured shortcodes (such as [php] which allows raw PHP code to be run) are vulnerable to serious attacks if WooThemes are installed, even if they are not the selected theme for the site. </p></blockquote>\n<p>While the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2523147">Gist author for that post</a> took some heat for releasing the information the way that he did, others chimed in and stated the vulnerability should have never existed in the first place. According to Jason Gill who is a WooThemes paying customer and also the one who announced the vulnerability on the Gist website explained that he made every effort to try and contact WooThemes or at least, see if the patch was already in existence but was unsuccessful. </p>\n<p>While at the time of writing this article WooThemes.com is offline, I advise you to check back often to update your themes as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/woothemes-releases-survey-results-as-an-infographic" rel="bookmark" title="WooThemes Releases Survey

href="http://managewp.com">ManageWP</a>, the service that makes it a breeze to manage multiple websites from one location has announced that they are currently developing an iOS application specifically for ManageWP. This move takes the ease of managing multiple websites to the next level. While the app is not yet available, there are a couple of screenshots of what the final product might look like.</p>\n<p>The first screenshot shows a concept of what the dashboard might look like. I have not tested the app itself but it will be interesting to see if they manage to pack all of their sites functionality into the iPhone app while still maintaining ease of use. </p>\n<div id="attachment_6537" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mwp_ios_dashboard.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mwp_ios_dashboard.jpg" alt="" title="mwp_ios_dashboard" width="202" height="302" class="size-full wp-image-6537" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ManageWP Dashboard Concept Image</p></div>\n<p>What may be the most exciting part of this news is that the app will also be available to use on the iPad. With more screen real estate and the retina display on the newest version of the iPad, this combination should make for a great experience.<br />\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mwp_ios_ipad.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mwp_ios_ipad-383x500.jpg" alt="ManageWP iPad Concept" title="mwp_ios_ipad" width="383" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6538" /></a></p>\n<p>Pricing has yet to be determined and in some aspects, this could get tricky. While the app is no use to non ManageWP customers, will the company end up charging for the app for existing customers? Considering there are <a href="http://managewp.com/plans-and-pricing">three different</a> service plans, I could see them offering the app for free to those who are middle and top tier plan customers. I know that the folks from ManageWP monitor this website so if you have feedback on how they should go about this, please offer your feedback within the comments. </p>\n<p>While there are alternatives to ManageWP, they are certainly experiencing healthy growth. Earlier this year, they hit the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/08/idUS181166+08-Mar-2012+PRN20120308">100,000 managed websites</a> milestone. They have also obtained <a href="http://managewp.com/managewp-surpasses-2000-paying-customers">2,000 paying customers</a>. Speaking of paying customers, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/vaultpress-not-an-option-for-non-profit-multisite-installations#comments">read through the comments</a> of a post I published about a week ago where a number of folks chimed in that while ManageWP is awesome, their prices are a bit too high to digest. Based on feedback I have observed, there are two camps. One that says ManageWP is worth every penny that they currently charge and one that says the prices are just too high. </p>\n<p>If you believe their prices are too high, consider the following. They currently have a staff of 20 or so people with plans to add more. They are an international bunch and the company is growing rapidly. There is the infrastructure, hardware, etc that they have to pay for. In my opinion, they shouldn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.sanebox.com/blog/death-freemium/">price themselves out of business</a>.

In order to view a member&#8217;s profile, a list of user groups, an activity stream, your friends, the active WordPress theme needs to have the proper templates to output those things. If the templates don&#8217;t exist, the page won&#8217;t display. Pretty simple, right?</p>\n<h4>Wrong.</h4>\n<p>There are two fundamental problems with this approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bolting BuddyPress into an existing theme is really difficult. It&#8217;s a rabbit hole of modifications just to get things usable, and another hole to make it actually look pretty and cohesive with the existing theme&#8217;s styling and layout.</li>\n<li>When the BuddyPress development team wants to update the Default Theme, we do so at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with existing themes that expect for it to work a specific way.</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Third-party BuddyPress plugin authors feel this pain even more-so, as they&#8217;re dependent on parent themes, child themes, and their own functionality all aligning correctly.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>The first problem is the most common, and also the most frustrating to most new users. <em>&#8220;I already have the site I want, but I want this feature that BuddyPress can provide. How do I make them work together?&#8221;</em> The answer to this question isn&#8217;t simple, and it&#8217;s a huge detriment to the new experience of setting up BuddyPress to have to lurk around the HTML and template files, and butcher your pretty theme to make things fit.</p>\n<p>The second problem is more common to developers and designers, and also prevents the BuddyPress development team from exploring any amazing new ideas with the project at its core. When we want to build something new, or improve an existing feature that&#8217;s falling a bit behind the times, existing templates can&#8217;t evolve to match the functionality because it&#8217;s going to potentially break existing installations.</p>\n<h4>There&#8217;s a solution, and we think it&#8217;s pretty awesome.</h4>\n<p>In an undetermined future version of BuddyPress, we&#8217;re going to start bundling template parts along with features. These template parts are intended to be the canonical set of skeletal styling that BuddyPress provides out of the box. It has the benefit of being a turn-key installation for everyone, and allows us to push out updates more quickly and evolve the platform without worrying about how themes that are outside of our control might break. These templates will work with *any* existing standard WordPress theme without any modifications.</p>\n<h4>Sounds neat, eh?</h4>\n<p>Surprise! <a href="http://bbpress.org">bbPress</a> already works this way, and it&#8217;s not far off for BuddyPress to inherit this new functionality, too. The purpose of this particular post and announcement is really two-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We know that this is an issue for our users, and we don&#8217;t like being stuck in this rut either.</li>\n<li>We want to get the word out early about the change so anyone that needs to adapt has ample time to do so.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>What does this really mean for me?</h4>\n<p>Very little, actually. <img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  If you&#8217;re using a derivative or a child theme of &#8220;bp-default&#8221; it will continue to work as it always has. If you&#8217;d rather check out what the bundled and white labeled styling looks like, you&#8217;ll be able to switch back and forth between the two seamlessly. The Default BuddyPress theme has had a good run, and we&#8217;re going to continue to include it and support it for the foreseeable future. What we want to do is shift our dependency from a theme we&#8217;re afraid to change, towards a set of templates that we love to improve.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://buddypress.org/community/groups/requests-feedback/forum/topic/theme-compatibility-4/">forum topic</a> specifically for this discussion about how theme compatibility will work, and to answer any questions and talk more about its future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 23:09:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"John James Jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 4/21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11311";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/0BKhe16Ef5Y/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1143:"<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11312" title="express" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/express.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://emptynestthemes.com/2012/04/20/express-theme/"><strong>Express</strong></a> is a basic, simple theme that would be suitable for any blog or website.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11313" title="nextsaturday" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nextsaturday.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/next-saturday"><strong>Next Saturday</strong></a> is a bold and playful theme which adds a touch of childlike innocence to your blog.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11314" title="typhoon" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/typhoon.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="81" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://gramish.net/typhoon-free-wordpress-theme"><strong>Typhoon</strong></a> is a simple blue theme.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/0BKhe16Ef5Y" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 14:00:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress 3.3.2 and 3.4 Beta 3 Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11306";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/xZ2vhK8SaB8/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1251:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> 3.3.2 and 3.4 Beta 3 <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-3-2/">have been released</a>.

I think it is appropriate to outline how this can be exploited to help provide some context to Cart66 customers, but I don&#8217;t want to be the one making it more likely that people will exploit the vulnerability on their sites.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While I am generally willing to take the explanation of how this vulnerability was allowed to remain unaddressed for such a long time at face value, I also believe this shows a fundamental lack of emphasis on security throughout the Cart66 organization. Someone received my email, replied that this was already a known problem, then nothing happend. Who knows, perhaps the people involved with that response aren&#8217;t even with the company anymore, but I&#8217;m pretty darn sure that this wouldn&#8217;t happen in my shop. A security vulnerability is a &#8220;Drop everything, get it patched and get a new release out. NOW!&#8221; situation. I will take them at their word that they are working to address this internally, but I&#8217;m still not comfortable with what their response (or lack thereof) says about their culture.</p>\n<p>If I were advising the Cart66 team, I would tell them they need to take additional steps to make it clear to their customers that they are taking security seriously. I would recommend hiring <a href="http://coveredwebservices.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> (or another reputable consultant or firm) to do a full security audit of their code and product architecture.</p>\n<p>I would also create and publish a process by which developers can responsibly submit security concerns, patches, etc. This should be easy to find on the Cart66 website.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would establish the process by which security issues are communicated to customers (a mailing list, or similar). In the case of responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities, this should include giving customers reasonable time to upgrade before publishing any details of an exploit.</p>\n<p>All software has bugs, and some of these bugs have security ramifications. How you deal with them (and how you work with your customers when they are found) is what builds or destroys your reputation.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nI did receive an email response to my ticket about the new release, but that didn&#8217;t go to all customers&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 17:33:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"WPTavern: The Biggest Challenge For WordPress?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6524";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/qTYTSgAjtko/the-biggest-challenge-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:766:"<blockquote><p>WordPress’ biggest challenge over the next two years, and where we’re focusing core development, will be around evolving our dashboard to be faster and more accessible, especially on touch devices.

Joost de Valk has taken those stats as well as some others that his team discovered and <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress-stats/">generated an infographic</a> that visually represents the data. One of the stats that I find impressive is the fact that Freelancer.com reported that 100,000 WordPress developers across the world are listed on the service with reports of over 3.6 million dollars of WordPress projects completed. </p>\n<p>What&#8217;s even more impressive is that WordPress has yet to reach a saturation point. There are still plenty of people out there that some day could potentially become WordPress users. So while the numbers we see today are huge, I imagine they&#8217;ll be even bigger in the next 2-3 years. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/all-the-stats-you-need-to-know-regarding-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="All The Stats You Need To Know Regarding WordPress">All The Stats You Need To Know Regarding WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/handful-of-codex-stats" rel="bookmark" title="Handful Of Codex Stats">Handful Of Codex Stats</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/woothemes-releases-survey-results-as-an-infographic" rel="bookmark" title="WooThemes Releases Survey Results As An Infographic">WooThemes Releases Survey Results As An Infographic</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/OxeHoMmrifU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 13:00:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"Alex King: Warning: Cart66 Vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=13203";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://alexking.org/blog/2012/04/16/warning-cart66-vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2223:"<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Please see this <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2012/04/17/cart66-vulnerability-follow-up">follow-up post</a>.</p>\n<p>Last summer we were working on an e-commerce site that integrated Cart66 with WordPress. As part of the development effort there, my team at <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> discovered a vulnerability in Cart66.</p>\n<p>We reported this to the Cart 66 team on July 11, 2011 and received the following response on July 12, 2011:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex,<br />\nWe are aware of this issue and are working on a solution. I dont have a date for the fix but we&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last week (on April 10, 2012) I received the following email:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Alex,</p>\n<p>We haven&#8217;t heard from you in 3 or more weeks so we are going to go ahead and solve this ticket. Do not hesitate to reply if you have any further questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My guess is that this is an automated email generated by their ticket system, but it reminded me I&#8217;d never properly followed up on the issue. We tested the current version of Cart66 (version 1.4.5) and the vulnerability is still present.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp San Francisco last summer I posed a question during the Q&amp;A session to get input from others on the best way to handle this situation. The agreed on course of action was to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Responsibly disclose the issue privately to the developer.</li>\n<li>Give the developer time to address the issue.</li>\n<li>Go public with the information if the issue is not addressed (it&#8217;s more important to let the users of the software know about the issue than it is to extend any &#8220;security by obscurity&#8221;).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As such, we plan to release the details of this vulnerability in two weeks (on April 30th).</p>\n<p>We sincerely hope that the Cart66 team will address the vulnerability with a release that fixes the issue before this time (and responsibly notify their customers of the issue and the importance of upgrading). However, given the overall lack of response we&#8217;ve seen from the Cart66 team on this issue, my recommendation would be to evaluate other e-commerce solutions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 20:27:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"Lorelle on WP: WordPress Stats Infographic of WordPress World";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=5950";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/wordpress-stats-infographic-of-wordpress-world/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:493:"Using some of the stats from my recent article on WordPress Stats, Yoast did some more research and created a new WordPress Stats Infographic to feature the statistical information on WordPress visually.

Any time I read a post like this, it&#8217;s as if I can hear the core team in my head yelling out &#8220;<strong>patches welcome</strong>&#8220;. But you know, just because you dedicate time to produce a patch that includes the functionality you would like to see in core that works flawlessly with WordPress does not guarantee that the functionality will end up within the core of WordPress. So in that sense, you&#8217;re damned if you do and damned if you don&#8217;t. Of course, there is always the plugin route. </p>\n<p>I agree with Dev4Press when they mention that the built-in search functionality in WordPress sucks and needs a major overhaul. It&#8217;s something that many users have requested for over two years. Unfortunately, due to complexity or lack of resources, we have yet to see any overhaul on this part of WordPress. There are plugins that enhance this ability but nothing within the core that makes it better. The other issue I wanted to address with the post on Dev4Press concerns their request that Akismet be removed from the default WordPress package as they think it&#8217;s a commercial plugin and thus, unfair to commercial plugin authors. In my opinion, as long as Akismet has the free option, it&#8217;s not a commercial plugin. However, I&#8217;d still like to see it and all other plugins removed from the default installation package just to tidy things up. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/my-bid-for-advanced-exporter-into-core" rel="bookmark" title="My Bid For Advanced Exporter Into Core">My Bid For Advanced Exporter Into Core</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/im-pretty-happy-with-my-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="I&#8217;m Pretty Happy With MY WordPress">I&#8217;m Pretty Happy With MY WordPress</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/9cn4oJLzOo4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 13:00:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Mon, 14 May 2012 22:02:26 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"125143";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Mon, 14 May 2012 21:45:13 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 139";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20090627192103";}', 'no');

Our booth was packed to overflowing last year as we helped people with their blogs and gave away WordPress swag, so this year we&#8217;ll have more space to meet as many of you as possible. Stop by if you need a helping hand with your site, or just to say hi. We&#8217;ll also have buttons, stickers, and t-shirts again this year.</p>\n<h3>Party</h3>\n<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/">WordPress party</a> will be hosted by the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org">WordPress Foundation</a> on Monday, March 12 from 6-9pm. Space is limited, so make sure you <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/">RSVP</a> (no SXSW badge is required). The party this year will be at the <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/thehouse/">Buzzmedia Pure Volume House</a>, and the story of how we hooked up with them is pretty cool.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, David Wang had a business called Buzzmedia in Malaysia, with the twitter username @buzzmedia. When David changed gears and started <a href="http://clickwp.com/">ClickWP</a>, a WordPress support business, he stopped going by the Buzzmedia name. In the U.S., a company also called Buzzmedia wished it had that Twitter username, and asked if they could have it since David wasn&#8217;t going to use it anymore.</p>\n<p>David, feeling the WordPress community love, said he would give them the name, and suggested they do something in return for the WordPress Foundation. So, everyone talked to everyone else and it worked out that Buzzmedia was willing to donate a fantastic venue for this year&#8217;s party as well as covering the bar.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Foundation got a great SXSW party, Buzzmedia got their twitter username, and David got the warm glow of having used his power for the good of the WordPress community, and they all lived happily ever after.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, though, the PureVolume House is always a great SXSW venue, so thank you David and Buzzmedia for your generosity! We&#8217;ll have drinks and snacks and a few hundred WordPress-loving partygoers, so you know it will be a good time. Kind of like a WordCamp afterparty without all the work of a WordCamp. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<p>The venue can hold 500 people, and based on last year, we&#8217;ll hit that pretty quickly. The one requirement is that you use WordPress. On the RSVP form, you will be asked to enter the URL of your WordPress-powered site (if you have more than one, just pick your main site). If you fill in this field with something other than what&#8217;s requested (such as &#8220;N/A&#8221; or putting in a fake url) your RSVP may be deleted, so please make sure to enter your real site.<br />\n<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/"> RSVP Now</a>!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/03/wordpress-takes-sxsw-2012/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Year of the Meetup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 20:17:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2210";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:456:"We hereby declare 2012 as the Year of the WordPress Meetup.

Basically, it&#8217;s people in a community getting together &#8212; meeting up &#8212; who share an interest in WordPress, whether they be bloggers, business users, developers, consultants, or any other category of person able to say, &#8220;I use WordPress in some way and I like it, and I want to meet other people who can say the same.&#8221; Meetups come in different shapes and sizes, but they all carry the benefit of connecting you with potential collaborators and friends, and helping you learn more about what you can do with WordPress. Here are some of the common types of WordPress meetups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hang out and work on your WordPress sites together</li>\n<li>Social/happy hour type gatherings</li>\n<li>Mini-lectures/presentations</li>\n<li>Developer hacking meetups</li>\n<li>Show &amp; tell of how group members are using WordPress</li>\n<li>Formal instruction on how to use WordPress</li>\n<li>Lecture series (possibly with visiting speakers)</li>\n<li>Genius bar/help desk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no prescribed format, as each local group can decide for itself what they want to do. Some groups mix it up from month to month, while others have multiple events each month to satisfy the needs of their community.</p>\n<p>The tough part? Running a popular group takes time and money. Just as we worked last year to remove the financial burden for <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamp</a> organizers and provide logistical support so they could focus more on their event content and experience, we want to start extending that kind of support to meetup groups as well. We don&#8217;t want it to cost anything for someone to run a WordPress meetup, or to attend one &#8212; building local communities should be as free as WordPress itself!</p>\n<p>Since there are so many more meetups than there are WordCamps, we&#8217;re going to start with the cost that is the same for every group: meetup.com organizer dues. We&#8217;re setting up an official WordPress account on <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> right now, and over the next couple of weeks will be working with existing meetup group organizers, people who want to start a new meetup group, and the helpful folks at Meetup.com to put this program in place. WordPress meetup groups that choose to have their group become part of the WordPress account will no longer pay organizer dues for that group, as the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org">WordPress Foundation</a> will be footing the bill.</p>\n<p>This is exciting for several reasons. First, it means local organizers who are giving something back to the project by way of their time won&#8217;t also have shell out $12-19/month for the privilege. That alone is a big step. Second, it will open the door to more events and leaders within a community, since leadership and event planning won&#8217;t need to be tied to &#8220;owning&#8221; the meetup group. Third, more active meetup groups means more WordCamps, yay!</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial aspects, we&#8217;ll be working on ways to improve social recognition of meetup activity by incorporating feeds from the official meetup groups into the WordPress.org site, and including meetup group participation in the activity stream on your <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/">WordPress.org profile</a>.<sup>2</sup> I&#8217;m also hoping we can do something around providing video equipment to meetup groups (like we already do for WordCamps) to record presentations and tutorials that can be posted to <a href="http://WordPress.tv">WordPress.tv</a>, helping meetup groups offer WordPress classes in their community, and getting involved with mentoring WordPress clubs at local schools and universities. Oh, and we&#8217;ll send out some WordPress buttons and stickers to the groups that join in, because everyone loves buttons and stickers.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also putting together some cool resources for people who want to start a new meetup group. There will be a field guide to getting started and some supplies to help you get your group going, and a forum for organizers to talk to and learn from each other.</p>\n<p>Over time, we&#8217;ll be talking to organizers and looking at what other expenses we can absorb and what other support we can provide to local groups. For now, we&#8217;re starting with the organizer dues. If you currently run a WordPress meetup group (whether you are using Meetup.com or not) or would like to start a WordPress meetup group in your area, please fill out our <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>. Filling in the survey doesn&#8217;t obligate you to join the official group, it just gives us a starting point to a) find out what groups are around/interested, and b) get some information on existing groups and their expenses and needs. Meetup.com will contact the group organizers who&#8217;ve said they&#8217;d like to join the new program, and will walk them through the logistics of the change and answer questions before helping them to opt-in officially.</p>\n<p>So, if you currently run a WordPress meetup group, or you would like to start one, please  fill out our <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>.

Today, I&#8217;m breaking our no-politics rule, because <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">there&#8217;s something going on</a> in U.S. politics right now that we need to make sure you know about and understand, because it affects us all.</p>\n<p>Using WordPress to blog, to publish, to communicate things online that once upon a time would have been relegated to an unread private journal (or simply remained unspoken, uncreated, unshared) makes <strong>you</strong> a part of one of the biggest changes in modern history: the democratization of publishing and the independent web. Every time you click Publish, you are a part of that change, whether you are posting canny political insight or a cat that makes you LOL. How would you feel if the web stopped being so free and independent? I&#8217;m <del>concerned</del> freaked right the heck out about the bills that threaten to do this, and as a participant in one of the biggest changes in modern history, you should be, too.</p>\n<p>You may have heard people talking/blogging/twittering about SOPA &#8212; the Stop Online Piracy Act. The recent <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">SOPA-related boycott of GoDaddy</a> was all over the news, with many people expressing their outrage over the possibilities of SOPA, but when I ask people about SOPA and its sister bill in the Senate, PIPA (Protect IP Act), many don&#8217;t really know what the bills propose, or what we stand to lose. If you are not freaked out by SOPA/PIPA, please: for the next four minutes, instead of checking Facebook statuses, seeing who mentioned you on Twitter, or watching the latest episode of Sherlock*, watch this video (by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a>).</p>\n<p>    <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31100268" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the U.S. our legal system maintains that the burden of proof is on the accuser, and that people are innocent until proven guilty. This tenet seems to be on the chopping block when it comes to the web if these bills pass, as companies could shut down sites based on accusation alone.</li>\n<li>Laws are not like lines of PHP; they are not easily reverted if someone wakes up and realizes there is a better way to do things. We should not be so quick to codify something this far-reaching.</li>\n<li>The people writing these laws are not the people writing the independent web, and they are not out to protect it. We have to stand up for it ourselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blogging is a form of activism. You can be an agent of change. Some people will tell you that taking action is useless, that online petitions, phone calls to representatives, and other actions won&#8217;t change a single mind, especially one that&#8217;s been convinced of something by lobbyist dollars. To those people, I repeat the words of Margaret Mead:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are not a small group. More than 60 million people use WordPress &#8212; it&#8217;s said to power <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all">about 15% of the web</a>. We can make an impact, and you can be an agent of change. Go to <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">Stop American Censorship</a> for more information and a bunch of ways you can take action quickly, easily, and painlessly. The Senate votes in two weeks, and we need to help at least 41 more senators see reason before then. Please. <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">Make your voice heard</a>.</p>\n<p><em>*Yes, the latest episode of Sherlock is good.

Check out this short video that summarizes the things we think you&#8217;ll find are the cat&#8217;s pajamas:</p>\n<div id="v-I7NAw9Zk-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-I7NAw9Zk-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=I7NAw9Zk&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.3 &quot;Sonny&quot;" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>Experienced users will appreciate the new <strong>drag-and-drop uploader</strong>, hover menus for the navigation, the new toolbar, improved co-editing support, and the new Tumblr importer. We&#8217;ve also been thinking a ton about what the WordPress experience is like for people completely new to the software. Version 3.3 has significant improvements there with<strong> pointer tips</strong> for new features included in each update, a friendly welcome message for first-time users, and revamped help tabs throughout the interface. Finally we&#8217;ve improved the dashboard experience on the iPad and other tablets with better touch support.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There is a ton of candy for developers as well. I&#8217;d recommend starting your exploration with the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor">new editor API</a>, new jQuery version, better ways to hook into the help screens, more performant post-slug-only permalinks, and of course the entire list of improvements <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3">on the Codex</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.3">in Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>Roll the Credits</h3>\n<p>The Credits tab on the new About WordPress screen in the WordPress dashboard provides recognition for contributors to each release, but we like to thank them here as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

I love it.  I thought I would post this in order to give some information that anyone who is going gluten free might not know.  If you decide to go out for sushi, you will need to be very careful about your choices.  There is wheat in nearly everything.  Regular california rolls or anything made with imitation crab will have wheat.  Almost all soy sauce has wheat.  I buy wheat free San-J Lite Tamari organic soy sauce.  Generally it is safest to make it yourself unless the restaurant you are in can give you a precise and detailed list of ingredients.  These spicy rolls are made with shrimp/salmon and tuna.  and I used my own soy sauce for dipping.  delicious!<br />On another note- We make a really mean <span style="font-style: italic;">Shrimp Salad Roll</span>  that I plan to serve this weekend.

Ken and I had made this in the past and really thought it was great.  I have been avoiding dairy for a while but I decided to go ahead and make this for a treat!<br />This pizza dough recipe is right on the package of Bob''s Red Mill Gluten free Garbanzo &amp; Fava Flour. we have made a few small adjustments.<br />Pizza Dough-<br />Ingredients:<br />1 Tbsp.  gluten free- dry yeast<br />2/3 cup Bob''s Red Mill Garbanzo &amp; Fava flour<br />1/2 cup Tapioca flour<br />2 Tbsp. Dry milk powder<br />2 tsp. Xanthan gum<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />1 tsp. unflavoured gelatin<br />2/3 cup warm water (105° F)<br />1/2 tsp. sucanat<br />1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil<br />1 tsp. Cider Vinegar<br /><br />1 baking stone<br />parchment paper<br />cornmeal for dough shaping<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. preheat oven to 425° F<br /><br />2. In med. bowl use regular beaters (not dough hooks), blend the yeast. flours, dry milk powder, xanthan gum, salt and gelatin at low speed.  Add the warm water, sugar, olive oil and vinegar.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. The dough will resemble soft bread dough.  (if the dough is to stiff to beat, you may need to add a little water)<br /><br />3.press out the dough on parchment paper into a pizza shape.  use some cornmeal to keep it from sticking to your hands and the parchment. Keep the edges a bit thicker for a nice crust.<br /><br />4. Bake the pizza crust on the pizza stone (and the parchment paper) for 10 minutes. remove from oven, spread your pizza sauce and toppings on top.  don''t overload it.  it''s a thin crust and doesn''t need heaps of cheese etc.<br /><br />5. return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is browned (about 10-15 minutes but watch).<br /><br /><br />Pizza Sauce Ingredients:<br />1 Tbsp Olive oil<br />1/4 onions (chopped fine)<br />2 cloves garlic, pressed<br />1 cup fresh tomatoes (pureed in the blender)<br />1/8 cup red wine<br />1 tsp. salt<br />1/4 tsp. black pepper<br />1 tsp. fresh oregano, chopped<br />1 tsp. fresh basil, chopped<br />1 red hot chile pepper, diced<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. in a large skillet, heat the oil and saute the garlic and onion until soft and browned<br />add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, hot chile peppers and red wine.<br /><br />2. cook on medium , stirring frequently until the sauce is slightly reduced.<br /><br />Pizza Directions!<br /><br />we used, thinly sliced mushrooms, chopped yellow bell pepper, chopped onions, black olives  and fresh goat mozzarella on our pizza.  spread out your toppings thinly and don''t overlap.<br /><br />When you follow the directions for the pizza dough you will get a crisp, bubbly pizza crust that could easily pass for a normal flour crust.  It was very successful and between 4 of us we ate 2 entire pizzas (we made a second batch of the dough).', 'Thin Crust Pizza with Organic goat mozzarrella, mushrooms, olives and yellow pepper', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'thin-crust-pizza-with-organic-goat-mozzarrella-mushrooms-olives-and-yellow-pepper', '', '', '2009-06-09 14:40:00', '2009-06-09 14:40:00', '', 0, 'http://the10centdesigner.com/blog/2009/06/09/thin-crust-pizza-with-organic-goat-mozzarrella-mushrooms-olives-and-yellow-pepper/', 0, 'post', '', 2),

(145, 1, '2009-06-18 01:17:00', '2009-06-18 01:17:00', 'Here is a list of my 10 favorite foods and why.  all of which happen to be quite healthy.<br />Oh, and we buy organic products from local shops.<br /><br />1. almond butter.<br /><br />I eat a little natural almond butter everyday.  usually I smear it on fruit like an apple or banana.  I have found that raw nuts are not always easy for my IBS ridden system to digest,  but a Tbsp. of almond butter won''t cause me any problems. Rich in monounsaturated fat, almonds are a filling nutritional powerhouse.  one ounce contains about 6g of protein and 3 g of fibre.  plus they (almonds) are rich in calcium, phosphorous, vitamin E and magnesium.<br /><br />2. avocados.<br /><br />again, rich in monounsaturated fat (to help LOWER cholesterol), avocados taste delicious.  They are great for your skin and hair and they have tons of fibre. 11-17g per avocado!.  Potassium, folate, vitamin A, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin and more!  again, so satisfying and filling that you don''t feel the need to over eat.  I use them in salads, with eggs, on pizza, smashed into gaucamole and all by themselves.  several times per week.<br /><br />3. broccoli sprouts.  also pea shoots, mixed sprouts, any sprouts!  I love sprouts.<br /><br />Sprouts are baby plants, which means when you eat them you get all of the nutrional benifits of the mature plants condensed into each one of those little tastey morsels.  Sprouts are a concentrated source of nutrition.  They are full of enzymes, vitamins and amino acids.  not to mention fibre!.  I put them on top of everything.  I eat them along with a little salt.  I honestly use salad dressings only in the evening.  I prefer my sprouts at lunch totally undressed.<br /><br />4. prunes.<br /><br />I adore prunes.  officially they have changed their name to  dried plums.  I like Earthbound Farm''s Organic premium pitted dried plums.<br />antioxidants, Vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, iron and of course TONS OF FIBRE.<br />I eat 4-6 prunes a day.  yes I do.<br /><br />5. eggs.<br /><br />we buy organic free range eggs.  I eat them poached, boiled and in the occasional omelette.<br />excellent source of protein, loaded with vitamins and minerals, great for hair and nails, eat with spinach for a real healthy mix that can improve your eye health.<br /><br />6. carrots.<br /><br />I eat them for breakfast. I eat them at lunch.  raw, boiled, roasted. whatever!  carrots are sweet and delicious and full of good things.  Antioxidants, beta-carotene, calcium, potassium, vitamin A, fibre and more!  Good for your eyes carrots will help you live longer.  One of those foods that will prevent cancer.  yep.  good stuff.<br /><br />7. berries.  my favs are blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. (in that order)<br /><br />since I try not to play favorites, I just eat them all together.  berries are my fruit salad base.  I will add, bananas, tangerines, oranges, kiwi fruit and other fruits to my berries.   But berries are always the base.  fruit salsa- needs berries!  hot or cold cereal- needs berries!<br />ok so they are full of antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and vitamins and minerals.  oh and fibre again!  just eat more berries.<br /><br />8. spinach.  I have always loved spinach<br /><br />I like it raw, wilted, stewed, in baby form, in salads, as a substitute for rice in a meat dish, by itself as a snack, in my omellete.<br />Vitamin K, calcium, magnesium,beta-carotene, iron, lutein.  oh and it''s super low cal.  eat an  entire bunch of it if you like.<br /><br />9. wild pacific salmon.<br /><br />Omega-3s!  Omega-3s!  oh wow.  so good for you.  notice- I say wild pacific salmon.  Northern wild salmon (alaskan) is relatively mercury free.<br /><br />10. dark chocolate<br /><br />Green and Blacks 85% dark chocolate is my favorite.  If like me you can''t stop once you start , it''s best to buy it only as an occasional treat.  :)<br />flavonoids reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and excellent to lower blood pressure.  Go for dark chocolate , the darker the better.  the less sugar the better as well.  of course.<br /><br /><br />I''ll do some other lists later.<br />1. oils and spices<br />2. things I avoid and why', 'My 10 favorite Foods', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-10-favorite-foods', '', '', '2009-06-18 01:17:00', '2009-06-18 01:17:00', '', 0, 'http://the10centdesigner.com/blog/2009/06/18/my-10-favorite-foods/', 0, 'post', '', 11),

The recipe is super vague and expects you to have some knowledge so I have adapted it and written it down in a way that any old girl could whip it up.<br /><br />1 Cup of Cargamanto Cranberry Beans<br />First things- rinse your beans and then soak them.  Soak them for around 6-8 hours.  Do this in the morning and your beans will be ready to cook by late afternoon.  The dish will take at least 2 hours to cook so don''t wait too long or the family will get hungry.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />as I said earlier- 1 cup of beans (rinsed and soaked for 6 hours)<br />1/2 cup white onion, diced<br />1/2 cup carrot, diced<br />1/4 cup celery, diced<br />3 cloves garlic, pressed<br />1 red hot chile, diced<br />1/2 cup sweet potato, diced (I used a pretty purple asian sweet potato)<br />2 cups gluten free chicken or vegetable stock if you are a vegetarian<br />3 cups water<br />2 Tbsp. Ghee<br />2 Tbsp. Garam Masala<br />1/2 lemon to squeeze over dish at serving time<br />Fresh cilantro from your herb garden :)<br />and I used some edible flowers from my herb garden .  because they look nice.<br />organic fruit chutney, I used a nice <a href="http://www.threesisterspies.com/page/page/4928371.htm">apricot/apple chutney</a><br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. melt ghee in a large lidded pot on med/high heat<br /><br />2. add the onions, garlic and hot pepper and stir for 1/2 minute.  Add the remaining vegetables and stir for about 3 or 4 minutes until the veggies are all starting to feel the heat, add the garam masala and stir for another minute.<br /><br />3.  pour in the gluten free chicken stock and the water, add the drained, rinsed beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and cover.  cook for at least 2 hours (until the beans are ready)<br /><br />4. Serve on a bed of brown basmati rice.  garnish with lots of cilantro, squeeze a little lemon on it all,  add a generous dollop of fruit chutney and maybe some edible flowers if you had them.  :)<br /><br />so delicious!<br />thanks chocokat!

Refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils are the thing to avoid (along with too much animal fat) .  Coconut has fiber, potassium, magnesium and lot''s of heart healthy medium-chain triglycerides.  MCT''s are mainly composed of a fat called lauric acid which is antiviral and antimicrobial (and preferably used by the body for energy rather than fat storing).  Studies have shown that the fat in coconut has no adverse affects on the heart or on general health.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> THAT said</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS is ice cream</span> and I''m not recommending you eat it everyday!  haha<br />The ingredients of Turtle Mountains coconut ice creams do meet my strict guidelines though.  and seriously, it''s way delicious.', 'Coconut Milk Ice Cream', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'coconut-milk-ice-cream', '', '', '2009-06-29 16:49:00', '2009-06-29 16:49:00', '', 0, 'http://the10centdesigner.com/blog/2009/06/29/coconut-milk-ice-cream/', 0, 'post', '', 6),

It was simpler to avoid oats altogether up until now.  There has been a great deal of research done that shows that (pure uncontaminated) <a href="http://www.celiac.ca/Articles/PABoats.html">oats do not cause problems for (most) people with celiac disease</a>.  For myself, my gluten intolerance can cause a major 3 day migraine (did I mention I have not had one in OVER a year and 2 months?!) Oats are a true health food. <br /><br />Well so anyhow, I decided to try some oats.  I started by purchasing some <a href="http://www.creamhillestates.com/en_home.php">Pure Oats</a> that are free of any cross-contamination with wheat, barley, rye, tricale, kamut, or spelt during growing, harvesting, transport, storage, mill processing and packaging.  Yes, they cost more than bulk oats.  I made myself a little hot oatmeal for breakfast.  Twice.  and then I waited for 72 hours after each consumption.  No Migraine!  woo hoo!  also no apparent digestive problems related to my IBS either.  awesome news.  <br /><br />And So I give you the most delicious granola ever.  I can say that because it has been sooooo long since I had granola!  But honestly it is great.  Kencent makes a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Ultimate-Irresistible-Granola/Detail.aspx">version</a> for himself with wheat germ and stuff I can''t have, but I think my version is extra delicious.  Keep it in a well sealed container and it will last for weeks.  <br /><br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />5 cups Pure uncontaminated rolled oats<br />1 cup raw organic almonds<br />1 cup raw organic walnuts broken into smaller pieces<br />1 cup raw organic sesame seeds<br />2 cups organic shredded coconut<br />1 cup raw organic sunflower seeds<br />1 cup organic virgin coconut oil<br />1 cup organic honey<br />1/2 cup organic raisins<br />1/2 cup organic dried cranberries<br />1/2 cup organic dried wild blueberries<br />1/2 cup organic dried cherries<br />salt, to taste<br /><br />(try to purchase all of these items organic and hopefully you can get them sulphate free)  <br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. Preheat the oven to 325°F<br /><br />2. In a very large mixing bowl, stir together the oats, almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and coconut.  <br /><br />3. Melt the coconut oil and the honey together in a pot on the stove over medium heat. Stir them together as best as you can (they don''t mix well), and pour over the bowl of dry ingredients, stirring constantly until everything is mixed well. Add a little salt (tsp. or 2) and stir in.    <br /><br />4. Pour half of the oat mixture onto a cookie sheet (or pour it into 2 cookie sheets if your oven is large enough.  mine is not.) Spread it out evenly and bake it for about 18-20 minutes in the preheated oven.  The mixture should be nicely toasted light brown.  add 1/2 of the dried fruit, stir to incorporate and set this aside for 10 minutes to cool.  Repeat with a second cookie sheet full.  <br /><br />5.  Once both of the cookie sheets have cooled for about 10 minutes give them a stir to break up clumps.  Wait until the granola is room temperature before storing in airtight containers.  Remember to mark the gluten free version! especially if there are folks in the home who insist on making non GF versions.  teehee.  <br /><br />it''s good.  really good.

I highly recommend the website and the magazine.  We have been fans for years.  Since I am gluten free I was unable to add some chopped Thai salted preserved radish as every brand I could find had soy sauce in it (most soy sauce contains gluten).  We happen to live in a city with excellent Asian food markets.  If you don''t, you could probably order the unusual items on line and then make it once they arrived.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />2 Tbsp Tamarind paste or Tamarind concentrate<br />3/4 cup boiling water<br />3 Tbsp gluten free fish sauce<br />1 Tbsp rice vinegar<br />3 Tbsp sucanat (or sugar if you can''t find sucanat)<br />3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper<br />4 Tbsp. peanut oil<br />8 ounces dried rice stick noodles <br />2 large eggs<br />1/4 tsp. salt<br />12 ounces medium shrimp, peeled and deveined<br />3 cloves garlic, minced fine<br />1 med. shallot, minced fine<br />2 Tbsp dried shrimp, chopped fine <br />6 Tbsp chopped roasted unsalted peanuts<br />3 cups bean sprouts<br />5 medium green onions, green part only, sliced thin<br />fresh cilantro leaves for garnish<br />lime wedges for serving<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. In a medium bowl, add boiling water to the Tamarind paste or concentrate.  (if you have dry paste with seeds and fiber you will want to press it through a fine strainer once you have re hydrated it.  Our Tamarind paste was packed in water and already strained).  Stir in Fish sauce, rice vinegar, sucanat, cayenne pepper and 2 Tbsp oil.  set aside.  <br /><br />2. Cover Rice sticks with hot tap water in a large bowl, soak until softened, pliable and limp but not yet fully tender.  (20 minutes).  Drain noodles and set aside.  Beat the eggs and 1/8 tsp. salt in a small bowl and set aside.  <br /><br />3. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat until just starting to smoke (2 minutes).  Add the shrimp and sprinkle with remaining salt, cook tossing once in  a while, until shrimp are opaque and slightly browned on edges (3 minutes), transfer to plate and set aside.<br /><br />4. While skillet is off heat, add the remaining oil to the skillet &amp; swirl to coat.  add garlic, &amp; diced shallot, set skillet over med. heat and cook for 1 1/2 minutes, add eggs to the skillet and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until just scrambled (20 seconds).  Add noodles &amp; dried shrimp to eggs, toss to combine.  Pour the fish sauce/Tamarind mixture over the noodles, increase heat to high and cook, tossing occasionally until noodles are coated.  Add the peanuts, bean sprouts and most of the green onions and the shrimp to the skillet.

Put the unpeeled plantains in a steamer basket set over a pan of simmering water.  Steam for 10 minutes.  They should still be quite firm to the touch.  <br /><br />2. While the plantains are cooking, make the masala.  Heat the oil in a wok or pan and toss in the mustard seeds, followed by the cumin seeds and curry leaves.  As soon as the seeds begin to pop, add the onion, ginger & green chilies.  Turn the heat down to low, cover the pan, and cook for about 10 minutes (until the onion is softened)<br /><br />3. When the plantains are cool enough to handle, strip off the peel with a sharp knife and grate them lengthwise into thick coarse shreds.  <br /><br />4. Add the turmeric to the masala  while still on the heat, stir to combine.  Add the grated plantains and fry for another 5-7 minutes.  You want to make sure the plantain still has texture and bite.  If it is sticking, add a little  water.  <br /><br />5. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro, and add a squeeze of lemon.  Serve with rice.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the new potatoes, boil until fork tender. While they are boiling, pre-heat the oven to 450 with the rack on the top.<br /><br />2. Generously drizzle a sturdy cookie sheet with olive oil, After draining your cooked potatoes, place them on the oiled cookie sheet with space in between.  Use a potato masher to gently squish the potatoes (it works best to squish each on a little, turn the masher a quarter turn and then squish them a little more).  Be gentle, you want your potatoes to look about cookie shape at this point.  Brush some olive oil onto the squished potatoes, add some salt and fresh ground black pepper, finish with some fresh rosemary or herb of your choice.  <br /><br />3. Place the cookie sheet with the squished potatoes on the top rack of your pre- heated oven and bake for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are nicely browned and crispy.  Be prepared for fights over who gets the last one.  <br /><br /><br />Kenny''s Special Scram -<br /><br />Ingredients-<br /><br />2 Tbsp. red onion, chopped fine<br />2 Tbsp. red pepper, chopped fine<br />large handful of fresh baby spinach chopped fine<br />handful of button mushrooms, sliced<br />5 eggs<br />Butter for frying<br />paprika for garnish<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1.

Use a heat resistant spatula to break up the egg mixture a couple of times as it cooks.  Don''t over stir it.

My grandma used to make huge batches for us and send them via greyhound every Christmas.  I decided to make a gluten free version and I must say it worked out very nicely!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />6-8 cups boiled russet (or similar dry potato) potatoes (boil them with the skin on)<br />1 tsp. vegetable oil<br />dash of salt<br />as much Bob''s Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour as needed (between 1-2 cups).  You don''t want too much moisture in your potatoes or your finished dough.  <br /><br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. After boiling the potatoes, rice them with a potato ricer and let them sit until they are completely cooled down and room temperature.  <br /><br />2. Once the riced potatoes are cool, add the vegetable oil and salt and mix.  Next add some flour (just a little at a time) and mix it in.  The dough should end up firm enough to roll out like pie crust.  Sprinkle flour on the rolling surface before trying to roll out the lefse rounds.  You want them very thin.  As thin as you can make them.  For this reason we rolled ours out on a sturdy cutting board in order to slide the lefse round onto the griddle without it breaking.  <br /><br />3. Place the rounds one at a time onto a hot frying griddle.  You could use a pancake griddle, a lefse griddle or even a cast iron pan if that is what you have.  Do not grease the griddle.  <br /><br />4. Cook each side until lightly browned.  Remove from heat and place on paper towel to cool a bit.  Store between sheets of wax paper.  <br /><br />5.  Lefse tastes great with a little butter spread on it and rolled up.  As kids we loved rolling it up with peanut butter and honey.  You can make a sandwich with it.  It freezes excellent (between sheets of wax paper).  It also keeps nicely in the fridge for a few days.  <br /><br /><br />I love LEFSE!  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OU-LXCEEY0M/Sy7u2OSiu6I/AAAAAAAAAXc/lkVT5veN2fA/s1600-h/lefse+examples+sq.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OU-LXCEEY0M/Sy7u2OSiu6I/AAAAAAAAAXc/lkVT5veN2fA/s320/lefse+examples+sq.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5417530017089502114" /></a>', 'Lefse', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'lefse', '', '', '2009-12-21 03:26:00', '2009-12-21 03:26:00', '', 0, 'http://the10centdesigner.com/blog/2009/12/21/lefse/', 0, 'post', '', 2),

Dude makes some long complicated food! We really enjoyed the taste though!   <br /><br /><br />We added to the complication by making our own gluten free Curry paste for his recipe.  Also, a few gluten free substitutions and omissions here and there.  <br /><br />First of all.  Keep in mind that you need to marinade the steak for 4- 8 hours.  <br /><br />Read through everything several times before starting.  <br />The Curry Paste will keep for a week in the fridge- use it in another dish that week!  <br />The BBQ sauce will keep in the fridge for 1 week.  Barbecue some chicken with it another day!<br />The BBQ Rub will last for ages in a sealed container.  Again, nice on any meat or veggie!  <br /><br />I would prepare it in this order.<br />1. start by making the curry paste, make marinade and marinade the steak in the morning.<br />2. make the BBQ rub and BBQ sauce.<br />3. make the avocado crema<br />4. grill the steaks, let sit<br />5. grill the onions while warming the tortillas and letting the steak sit.<br />6. eat three helpings like we did.  :)  <br /><br />Here we go-<br /><br />Curry Paste-<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 shallot, chopped fine<br />2 tsp. gluten free Thai chili sauce<br />4 cloves garlic, pressed<br />1 thumb size piece of fresh ginger, chopped fine<br />2 Tbsp organic tomato ketchup<br />1/2 Tbsp ground cumin<br />1 tsp. ground coriander<br />1/4 tsp. ground white pepper<br />3 Tbsp fish sauce<br />1 tsp. dried shrimp, ground in a mortar and pestle. <br />1 tsp. sucanat<br />2 Tbsp chili powder<br />2/3 cup coconut milk<br />2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice<br /><br />Directions- <br /><br />1.

I love sweet potatoes.  Luckily sweet potatoes are <a href="http://whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=64">very good for us</a>! This is one of my favorite ways to prepare them.  I always make extra so I can keep some in the fridge for a snack.  A sweet potato baked with skin is an excellent source of vitamin A. They are also a very good source of vitamin C and manganese. In addition, sweet potatoes are a good source of copper, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, potassium and iron. (you must eat the skin!)<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />3-5  small sweet potatoes  (I usually buy the yellow flesh variety from my organic market)<br /><br />2 Tbsp of either quality vegetable oil or olive oil<br /><br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />butter <br /><br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. Move oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400° F.  <br /><br />2. Wash and dry the outer skins of the potatoes.  Cut off any small hard bits.  Using a fork, stab the potatoes three or four times each.  <br /><br />3.  Rub the potatoes with oil to cover and arrange them on a foil lined baking sheet with space in between.  Bake for 40-50 minutes (do not turn) or until a knife slips easily into the center.  <br /><br />4.  Salt and pepper to taste and serve with a little butter if you are feeling decadent.

Eventually I had to give in and tonight we actually made some of the delicious crispy onion treats.  Of course I will need to pull a double at the gym tomorrow to work off the extra fat, but it was worth it.  <br /><br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />2 yellow onions, peeled & cut into 1/2 inch sections, rings pulled apart<br />2 cups buttermilk<br />1 1/2 cups Bob''s Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour<br />1/4 cup medium yellow cornmeal<br />3 liters vegetable oil <br />sea salt<br />Fresh ground pepper<br /><br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />1. Preheat your oven to 200°F (you will keep your onion rings crisp and warm in there as you do them in batches).<br /><br />2. In a medium bowl, combine the buttermilk, 1 1/2 tsp. salt and a tsp. fresh ground pepper.  mix and toss in your onion rings, toss to coat and let sit for at least 15 minutes.  <br /><br />3.  In another bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, 1 tsp. salt & 1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper. <br /><br />4. Preheat your vegetable oil to 350°F.  We used a deep fryer, but you could easily use a dutch oven and an attached candy thermometer.  (note we did our deep frying in the garage so as to avoid stinking up my little house with the scent of frying oil)  <br /><br />5. When your oil is hot, dredge a few onion rings in the flour mixture and place in the oil.  You must work in small batches so don''t crowd them!  Cook for a total of 2 minutes, turning once with some tongs about half way through the cook time.  <br /><br />6. Remove your batch of onion rings from the oil and place on a paper towel lined cookie sheet, salt lightly.  Place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven to keep the onion rings warm and crisp for up to 30 minutes while you deep fry the rest.  <br /><br />7. Eventually you will tire of making onion rings and then you will know you have enough.

I love how the two sites relate yet retain their profession specific appeal.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI asked my talented web designer Asher Compton to create something super new and shake up the internets with all of my new sites.  I''m super stoked and excited to show you all what he created.  I have asked Vaunt Visual to describe the entire process and the features of my new sites for you.
